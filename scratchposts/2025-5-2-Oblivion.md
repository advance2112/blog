WIP - Likely will not be finished

Having now played all of them over the course of nearly half of his life, what does this chump think of the series of games that have sold in excess of 100 million copies?

---

I recently finished The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, after having tried to play the original game in the past many times, but never finishing it until now. Playing a somewhat-new-to-me Bethesda RPG in 2025 has been an interesting experience, especially because of my growing awareness of video game development, as well as my growing experience with the genre. I had a number of thoughts rolling around in my head as I was bounding across Cyrodiil, and this is an attempt to catalogue those thoughts.

### The Dawn Era: Before Skyrim

To speak on my background with the series, the first Elder Scrolls game I played was Morrowind, though I didn't play much of it. Mind you, this is not some story about how I uncovered this "obscure" game. No, this was in 2012, and Skyrim was already on my radar, even if it was well out of my reach. You see, I was still on the 6th generation consoles, and even my PS2 saw little love in favor of the Xbox Original. The Xbox belonged to a friend of mine, but we hung out at my place so often that he would just leave his Xbox there for days or weeks at a time. It was clear to me at the time that, as cool as Skyrim looked, it would be a while still before I would have a chance to play it. And learning that Morrowind was from the same series piqued my interest, and drove me to try the game out. 

Unfortunately, my 13-year-old, Halo-spoiled brain was simply too smooth to be able to comprehend Morrowind much at all, perhaps due to my impatience at having to read all the text being thrown at me. I likely didn't get much further after reaching Balmora, though I can't say for certain.

My brother, however, played this game a ton. He was hooked. He would play for hours, late into the night, and I would watch with awe, once again not really fully parsing what was going on. My friend, the owner of the Xbox, was also absolutely enthralled by the game. But it wasn't for me, at least not yet.

### The Merethic Era: Skyrim

The night of the 24th of December, 2012 was a magical night. Not only was it a lovely evening at my grandfather's place celebrating Christmas, but once we got home, both my brother, my father, and myself were eager to get our new Xbox 360 hooked up. Of all games to be bundled in, this one came with a digital copy of Skyrim.

For some reason I got to play the game first, something about being the younger brother or something, I don't know. Honestly I don't remember much of that first time playing, it was simply too overwhelming, too novel, to the point where my brain couldn't process what I was seeing. Like the theory that the reason people can't remember the first few years of their life is that the brain is just overstimulated all the time, and is unable to form conscious memory. It was like that, the first few hours of Skyrim were like a gaming rebirth for me.

That said, there is one moment that night that I remember very vividly. I was tired, it was past midnight at this point, so I had handed the game off to my brother. I can't remember if he replayed the intro or if he just continued playing on my character, but I remember him waking me up as I slept. He had figured out that not only could you cast spells in both hands, but two different spells. He showed me his character shooting the basic ass fire and shock spells, shooting them into the sky above Whiterun. I think it was then that everything solidified. Not only was this a good game, it was magical.

The next few days, hell the next few months, it was like Skyrim was the only game that existed. All three of us would play for hours and hours, we had to make a system for who got how much play time. And even when we weren't playing, we would just sit there and watch each other play. We uncovered the mysteries of this strange new world slowly but surely, a grand adventure in a new land.

But it wasn't just a new land... it felt to me like the first land. I had played plenty of games with worlds to explore, Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, hell Halo has some amount of exploration, but this was something different. Because it wasn't just a physical world, it was a social, emotional, and strategic world, too. Skyrim showed me what video games can be, it taught me how to play and approach a complex game.

Now, I know what you're thinking: Skyrim is really not all that complex of a game, in fact it's much less complex than Morrowind, and you're right. Put a pin in that.

### The First Era: The Fallout of Oblivion

In the following years, I naturally picked up the other Bethesda RPGs: Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas. I tried to play each of these in turn, but just really couldn't get into any of them. I can't even say exactly what turned me off, I think there were just other games I was more interested in. Mind you this was my mid-teenage years, and I was deep in the throws of Halo and the like. I had my own Xbox and my own money to some degree, so I could play most any game I wanted to. And apparently I wanted to play Halo: Reach, Halo 4, and Minecraft more than I did the Bethesda RPGs.

Eventually, I picked up Fallout 3 and actually managed to finish it. It's kind of strange to realize that Fallout 3 is the second Bethesda RPG I ever actually honestly finished, crazy. I liked Fallout 3 at the time, but these days, not a fan. That said, of the subjects of this analysis, it is the game I am furthest removed from, having last played it around a decade ago. 

New Vegas, on the other hand, I still struggled to get into. At the time, I cited the fact that the game is much less friendly to aimless exploration, and kind of shoehorns you into the main quest, and that this turned me off from the game. Put a pin in that.

### The Second Era: Crawl Out From the Fallout

I was deeply caught up in the news cycle on Fallout 4. It was the first new Bethesda RPG since I started playing them. Unless you count The Elder Scrolls Online, which I do not. I remember keeping up on all the news through MrMattyPlays on YouTube, eating up every possible crumb of info. It was one of the first times I was ever hyped for a game release, and I think still the most hyped I've ever been for a game, with the possible exception of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

It's funny, I was so hyped for the game, yet I have still never actually purchased the game myself. My brother bought it on launch day, midnight release and all that. I didn't get to play it until the next day, and in fact I didn't get to play much. I was living away from my brother at the time, so it was less easy to share the game. So I waited patiently for him to be done with it. In the meantime, he said he wouldn't let me borrow it until I play New Vegas. All of it, including the DLCs.

So I obliged, essentially speedrunning the game as much as I could. I barely paid attention, barely engaged with the mechanics of the game, and barely understood what was going on. I appreciate my brother's efforts to try and get me to see the magic that is happening in New Vegas, but in truth I don't think I was quite ready for the game at 16. New Vegas became the third "Bethesda RPG" I "finished". Technically it's an Obsidian game, not a Bethesda game, and technically I sped through it so much and absorbed so little you could argue that I didn't really play the game... but sure, let's count it. 

Anyway, true to his word he let me borrow the game for a few weeks and, well.Fallout 4, the fourth Bethesda RPG I finished, is the first one I immediately disliked upon finishing it. I thought it was kind of lame, kind of boring, and kind of small. The settlements were less exciting than they sounded, especially considering they essentially replaced the smaller villages you find in other games. The gunplay, while improved, was still noticeably outdated. And the story and setting just didn't do it for me. I returned the game to my brother and haven't played it since, not even the DLC.

### The Third Era: You Either Die a True Nord or Live Long Enough to See Yourself Become the Morrowboomer

At this point, I was growing up, about to graduate high school and go off to college. Skyrim was still a fun distraction, still easily my favorite of this collection of games. I found myself often replaying the same few games over and over, like Minecraft, Halo, and of course Skyrim. Shortly before I graduated high school, I got my first gaming PC. The first game I bought was, of course, Skyrim. I finally was able to play the game properly modded. But I was growing disillusioned with the game. I was starting to see the cracks. Especially as I went on to play The Witcher 3 later that year. I vowed that I would not play Skyrim again until the year I graduated college, a vow I held, and I'm happy I did.

In the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore year, however, I started playing a bunch of new games, which was unusual for me. Stardew Valley, Factorio, Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, and Hotline Miami, all really excellent games I had played that year. But I was itching for an action adventure RPG. I really considered picking up Skyrim, and breaking that vow, but on the recommendation of friends, eventually settled on Morrowind.

I was not immediately sold on the game. I remember it being very confusing when I played it so long ago. Of course now I'm much old, able to not lose patience reading, and am able to parse a larger, more complex narrative. Plus I was playing the PC version, with MGSO to boot, making for a reasonably pleasant experience. After a while, I was hooked.

The main quest was a particular fixation, honestly one of the best quest lines in any RPG I've played. I certainly have ones from newer games I like more (Baldur's Gate 3, for example), but Morrowind still holds up today in many ways. I have fond memories of traveling the alien, ashen wastes, crawling up the cantons of Vivec, exploring the non-linear dungeons, and, of course, consulting the wiki. At the end of it, I was convinced it was the best Bethesda RPG, and I still believe it to be the best of the Elder Scrolls series (though I have not played Daggerfall).

### The Fourth Era: Bear Bull Bear Bull

At the start of 2021, the year I graduated college (but before I actually graduated), I picked up Skyrim again. Mind you it was still the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I really needed something to occupy the time. I only mention this because I think this was my last hurrah with actually enjoying Skyrim. I replayed it later in the year with the Anniversary Edition, and I really did not like that version. But the early 2021 run was good, it was fine, but it did solidify some thoughts I was having about the design of these games. Put a pin in that.

It wasn't until 2023 that I finally picked up New Vegas again. Why then? Couldn't tell you. I think a friend had played it recently and really wanted me to, so I did. I have a vivid memory of approaching the NCR outpost where you find Cassie, on your way to New Vegas. There are some ants on the road ahead, and the troops there mention that it's blocking trade. You ask them why don't they take care of it. They say their orders are to wait, not kill ants.

This, and so many other things about this game, made me see clearly the shortcomings of every other Bethesda RPG, even Morrowind. The complexity, the nuance, the storytelling; these are all things to marvel. Often your reaction to a piece of art reveals a little something about yourself, but New Vegas demands a larger tithe. The social and political environment of New Vegas is so rich with possibility, so ripe for a good tale, that the only way you can make the game not interesting is if you aren't paying attention. It's a world populated with unique and interesting characters, each with their own story, and plenty of room for you to tell your own story, and effect massive change to the world in the process. This is what RPGs are meant to be.

Oh yeah, and I played Starfield later that year. It was so bad it's not even worth writing about in detail. I have a lot of problems with the game. I did not like it.

And now we come to the true subject of this essay: Oblivion Remastered. The rumors were abuzz about the remaster, and I was still suspicious up until the leaked screenshots. Even then, I was skeptical of the release date. But I'll be damned, it was real, and now I've played it. I didn't even buy it, my brother did and I played his copy. For 90 hours.

Despite the playtime, I have a very strong conclusion about the game: This game is bad. Compared to what I have now seen is possible not just with RPGs, but in this same God damned engine, Oblivion is a mess. And the "Remastered" part does little to fix the core issues with the game. Like yes, the reworked levelling is nice, and the new visuals are... new. But honestly? The least interesting quest in Baldur's Gate 3 is better than the best parts of Oblivion.

### 


"gameplay loop"
Bethesda wants to generate infinite content
bethesda's fixation on procedurally generated content
oblivion is skyrim but worst in every way
morrowind is goated
morrowind is Bethesda's New Vegas
starfield is ass, too
shivering isles is the best part of oblivion
what makes for a good quest?
how much would it take to make a quest actually good?
the conclusion is that different people get different things out of each of these games
weird and interesting characters



But Skyrim was an amazing on-ramp for more complex games for me. Like yes, in retrospect, the quest design is mediocre or lazy 80% of the time, the characters are flat and uninteresting 90% of the time, and exploring a random cave you find is worth it only 20% of time, because the other 80% will require you to come back when you've obtained the relevant quest. And yeah, this all sucks, and makes for a repetitive and surprisingly monotonous game. 

I say surprising because, in truth, the premise of Skyrim is extremely compelling. You find yourself in a province divided by civil war between the traditionalists and the imperialists, when suddenly a plague of dragons falls on the land and you're the one chosen to end it. Like...?? That sounds so fucking rad like, yes let me live out my fantasy of being a viking slayer of mythical beasts in a complex social and political environment. But Skyrim falls short of that fantasy for me. 

Maybe it's because I've played the game to death, or because I've been "spoiled" by games with better writing (a low bar), but Skyrim doesn't play  like a fantastical scandinavia simulator, it plays like an engagement farm. It plays like a series of stories and quests that are just barely interesting enough to keep you going, given to you by characters that are fundamentally uncurious about the world they exist in.


 John Carmack's famous quote comes to mind here: "Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important." I have always taken issue with this quote. In 1992 when id Software was making Doom, this was true to a large degree. But things have changed, and there is a much larger focus on story in games. Just look at the entire genre of visual novels, a genre based around the fact that there is very little in the way of gameplay and is much more focused on story. Someone who had exclusively played and/or made visual novels may say the exact opposite to what Carmack said, that gameplay is expected to be there but isn't that important.

 But that said, I can appreciate the fact that not every game needs it. Look at Balatro, Factorio, and Minecraft, three games that I have clocked insane amounts of hours in and each have incredibly sparse stories. As much as I love these games, and as much as they have affected me, there are other games that have affected me just as much if not more in a much shorter amount of time. Disco Elysium, Outer Wilds, and, hell, Morrowind all come to mind. None of these are tiny, sure, but they are all story rich experiences. 
 
 All this is to say, story is important, John Carmack, what the hell are you talking about? A video game is a piece of media, just as a movie or book is. To diminish any quality of any medium and say that it's "not important" fundamentally weakens the concept of that medium. This quote has the same air as that cringey quote that's at the end of that one Skrillex song: "They're not artists because no one can play the guitar." Like, fuck you John Carmack, you sound like that boomer idiot who cannot conceptualize the idea of electronic music. You say that story is not that important because you've only ever played and made games where it isn't, just like that boomer only ever heard or played music that wasn't electronic. So yeah, I hate this quote, and I hate that fact that so many people like it.

 Like yeah, you can make a good game that has a bad or sparse story. But to say that having a bad, sparse, or unimportant story is foundational to the medium is dismissive at best, and harmful at worst.
