Eat crumb... consume crumb... become crumb...

[Crumbania](https://advance2112.itch.io/crumbania) was made in 9 days for the [Godot Wild Jam #83](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-83). The Jam's theme was "CONSUME".

### The Start
It's been a long, long time, hasn't it? [The last game jam I did](https://advance2112.github.io/blog/games/2024/11/17/LaRtOoD.html) went rather well, so why did it take me nearly 9 months to do another one? Well, four things were going on between LaRtOoD and this game. In this time, I:

1. Did post jam updates for all my previous jam games.
1. Started a personal game project that since has been put on pause.
2. Joined another large game project (Hemocoven) that, while good progress was made, I ultimately decided to quit working on for reasons detailed later in this post.
3. Played lots of really damn good video games, including getting Balatro's Completionist++ achievement, playing 3 different 3D RPGs, and buying both a PS5 and a Switch 2.

I wouldn't say I was 'busy' in this time, but rather 'occupied' and 'a bit depressed'. Even the two game projects I worked on never felt quite right in this time, not quite the same as a jam game.

Come late June, I'm occupying my time with a bunch of games throughout the month, and I'm just feeling a bit burnt out by it all. I as half-assing my work on Hemocoven, just barely holding myself together enough to make it into work in the morning. But for some reason I get the idea in my head that I need to make a game. Right, I put Hemocoven on pause for a while first, then decided to make the game. I said some bs like "my desire to create is really low right now", which was true but in retrospect I think it was moreso my desire to work on Hemocoven was really low.

### The Jam
Anyway, by the time I convince myself to make a game, the next GWJ is just a few days away from starting. So I say to myself "fuck it, I'll make a tiny little game, just something simple, a clone of some simple game. I'll make it in a weekend, I'll use pre-made assets, do whatever I need to to just shit this game out. That will be a good test of whether I really do have a low desire to create or if it's just Hemocoven dragging me down."
