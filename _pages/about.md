My name is Mark West and I'm an aspiring game developer.

After receiving my degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (in that order) from Xavier University in 2021, I've been working at [Flooid](https://www.flooid.com/), a Point of Sale software company. In that time, I have also worked on a number of video games as personal projects, which are [chronicled in this blog](https://advance2112.github.io/blog/). I've mainly worked in Godot, but also have experience with Unity and Game Maker Studio. If you're interested in working with me, please email me at markdavidwest01@gmail.com.
